# How this works?

Basically, I've got a website(repository is at the moment private) written in R, Ruby On Rails and normal javascript, html and stylus. 

The website forks(pipes) the mardown data straight onto the website which makes it easier for me to publish, and I don't really need to think about the website and I can easily put up my blogs.

I will surely in future put up my website as a public repository, I feel its good enough how it stands at the moment.
